#Question 1:Sum triangle generation:

This code uses 2 recursive functions to generate the sum of given number 

if we talk about the functions ans its prototype :

sumTriangle() function's work is to pass a new array of size -1 to the helper function and then print the array 
Helper funtion is the real game changer , it addes the 2 elements of initial array to the new array 

#Question 2:Chocolate wrap calculator

This code also uses two functions due to the pre given prototype , otherwise it could be done by using only one recursive function
the maxChocolate function is basically useless it only calculate the amount of chocolate that can be bought by money and then call the helper function to do furthur calculation 
the helper function calculate the amount of chocolate that is returned after giving the specific amount of wrappers 

#Question 3:Ellection vote tallying machine 
it contain a single recursive function that addes the even and odd votes from the given 2d vote array

#Question 4:Artifact matching
this is a basic recursive function that matches 2 2d arrays and return true if matched and fasle if not 

#Question 5:magic_maze
the rcursive function starts by checking the boundaried , and return fasle if the condition is true ,meaning if the recursive function reaches a boundary 
if not the function assignes the current index'P'and uses if statement to move arounf the index if true, function returns true , if boundary hit and E has not arrived the function goes back while assigning 1 to all the tiles that were P before
